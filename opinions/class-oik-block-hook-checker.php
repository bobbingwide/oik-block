 * Issue #25
 *
 * Related: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1316
 *
 *	Another way of checking plugin compatibility is to look internally into the code.
 *	The classic editor invokes hooks and filters in a certain way
 *	The block editor changes that way. 
 *	There's an issue to document the changes.
 *	It should be possible to build routines that determine if plugins attach functions to the hooks that are changing. 
 *	If the hook is no longer being invoked OR hooks are being invoked in a different sequence to expected there could be a problem. 
 *	As a test, let's see if we can detect an issue with
 *	-  hello-dolly, 
 *	- or any plugin that responds to the 'replace_editor' hook, 
 *	- or help hooks or screen option hooks.
 *	
 *	I'll raise a separate issue for this.
