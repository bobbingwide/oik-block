== Description ==
WordPress 5.0 blocks for oik shortcodes.

This is mostly prototype code delivering a number of the simpler oik shortcodes 
as blocks for the new WordPress content editor.

oik delivers over 80 shortcodes. 
Some of these are crying out to be converted into advanced WordPress blocks.

This is just the start. 

This plugin is currently being used for education, demonstration and experimentation.

Originally based on Zac Gordon's course, the code has been altered to work with the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin,
upon which it is currently dependent until it's merged into core.
