== Description ==
WordPress 5.0 blocks for oik shortcodes.

This is mostly prototype code delivering a number of the oik shortcodes 
as blocks for the new WordPress content editor.

oik delivers over 80 shortcodes. 
Some of these are crying out to be converted into advanced WordPress blocks.

This is just the start. 

This plugin is currently being used for education, demonstration, experimentation and estimation.

The code is being developed to work with latest version of the Gutenberg plugin,
upon which it is currently dependent, until the plugin is merged into core.

At some time in the future all references to Gutenberg may be eliminated.

We'll refer to Gutenberg as the new editor.
And each block will be called a block.

This plugin also includes logic to evaluate Gutenberg's compatibility with site contents.
It forms opinions at multiple levels and applies these to decide which editor is the safest to use for the content and context.
At some point in the future this logic may be extracted into a separate plugin.
