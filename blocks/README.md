## Build folder

The `build` folder contains the run-time components:

Folder | File | Contents
------ | ----- | -------
css    | blocks.editor.css | Styles used in the Block editor
css    | blocks.style.css | Styles used in the front end
images | js-wapuu.svg | wapuu SVG file - from Zac's course

## Build process

To build the JavaScript code in the blocks folder you need to use npm (Node Package Manager),
which is part of Node.js. 

If you don't already have it [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Check what versions you have using `node -v` and `npm -v`.

```
C:\Users\Herb>node -v
v8.9.4

C:\Users\Herb>npm -v
6.4.1 
```


npm 6 is needed for building Gutenberg 4.0.0


Then you need to install the dependencies locally.

```
npm install
```

Run this command from the plugin's directory. 

This will install a gazillion files into the `node_modules` folder, creating over 2000 sub-directories.

If you're unfamiliar with npm, then you may want to read something about it.
See [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) 
and [npm javascript package manager](and https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm)

To build the blocks into the run time code you then need to run either

```
npm run dev
```

or 

```
npm run build
```
